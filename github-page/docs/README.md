# Welcome

Welcome to TypeScript Guidelines

This guideline focus on *how to get the most out of TypeScript with minimal effort*.

To achieve that goal,
following some coding styles is a good place to start.

However, just following *what to do* can only go so far.
You need to know *why* should you write code in certain way,
*what* are the *trade-offs* you are making,
as well as the design and the limitations of the language itself,
so that you have the right *mindset* and *approach* the problem and come to a solution effectively.

Therefore, this book is not just a style guide or just about best practices.

I will cover everything related to TypeScript in order to achieve that goal.

This book is organized into a few sections:

- How to TypeScript: Designs, limitations, and approach
- TypeScript (and JavaScript) syntax and features
- Coding Styles and Guidelines
- Supporting Tools

Learning everything about TypeScript is not easy.

The language itself is pretty complex,
and both TypeScript and JavaScript evolves at a rapid pace.
So it can be quite overwhelming if you are just starting out.

I would recommend having a quick read through of the [How to TypeScript] section,
and then check out the [Supporting Tools] section to find out how to set up your project,
and use the rest of the book for reference as you need them.

Having that said,
I'm in the process of updating this book.

Most of the information are still in their old format.
So please head over to the [GitHub repo] to look for the original content for the time being.
