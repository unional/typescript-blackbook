# tsconfig.json

`tsconfig.json` contains compiler option for your TypeScript project.

`tsc` will automatically look for `tsconfig.json` in the current and parent folders.

You can also specify a different file by `tsc -p <config file path>`.

## Generate

`tsconfig.json` can be generated by running `tsc --init`.

## Json Completion for custom config files in VSCode

Add this to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

  ```js
  // .vscode/settings.json
  {
    "json.schemas": [
      {
        "fileMatch": [
          "tsconfig.*.json"
        ],
        "url": "http://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Guidelines

### Build config

- Use `tsconfig.build.json` for build purpose, and `tsconfig.json` for IDE.
- In `tsconfig.json`, use `exclude`.
- In `tsconfig.build.json`, use `files`.

  > Why?

You typically would write test files but don't want to bundle them in your package.
`tsconfig.build.json` uses the `files` property allows you to have fine grain control on what to include in your package,
while `tsconfig.json` uses the `exclude` property so IDE can includes your test files in the project thus providing better completion support.

For example:

```js
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "exclude": [
    "coverage",
    "dist",
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```

```js
// tsconfig.build.json
{
  "conpilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "files": [
    "src/index.ts",
    "typings/index.d.ts"
  ]
}
```

- use the same `compilerOptions` on both `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.build.json`

> Why?

While some options does not apply for IDE,
keeping them the same avoid confusion on whether something was missing or wrong when they are different.

## tsconfig.json at project root

- Use this to configure your development environment

> Why?

Some IDEs allow you to specific which configuration to use, but some does not.
Thus, it is better to use this to configure development environment while using other configs for build and CI.
