# 📝 Standard Article Template

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
tags: [typescript, category]
---
```

## Article Structure

### Title

Use H1 (`#`) matching the frontmatter title.

### Introduction

Brief introduction explaining what the topic is and when it was introduced (if applicable).

### Quick Example

Self-contained code snippet (≤ 25 lines) demonstrating the concept:

```ts
// Practical, real-world example
```

### Recommendations

For each recommendation, follow this pattern:

```markdown
You **should** [recommendation].

> Why?

[Explanation of benefits, trade-offs, and reasoning]
```

Use horizontal rules (`---`) to separate distinct recommendations.

### Feature Introduction Pattern

When introducing a TypeScript feature:

1. State what it is and when it was introduced
2. Provide a simple example
3. Explain practical use cases
4. Discuss recommendations and best practices

### Configuration Guidelines Pattern

When discussing configuration:

1. State the recommendation clearly
2. Show the configuration example
3. Explain why this configuration is beneficial
4. Mention alternatives or edge cases if relevant

### Best Practices Section

Use numbered lists for actionable best practices:

```markdown
## Best Practices

1. **Practice 1** - [brief explanation]
2. **Practice 2** - [brief explanation]
```

### References Section

Link to official documentation and related resources:

```markdown
## References

- [Official Documentation][link]
- [Related Resource][link]

[link]: https://example.com
```

## File Naming

- Use `snake_case` for file names (e.g., `monorepo_setup.mdx`, `naming_conventions.mdx`)
- Use descriptive nouns that represent the topic
- Use `.mdx` for articles with frontmatter and components
- Use `.md` for simpler markdown-only articles

## Required Rules

The AI agent should read and follow these rules along with the subject rule:

- **[Voice and Tone](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/voice_and_tone.mdc)**: For writing style
- **[Syntax Conventions](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/syntax_conventions.mdc)**: For formatting standards
- **[Review Rubric](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/review_rubric.mdc)**: For quality checklist
