# ✅ Review Rubric

An article is "ready" only if ALL items are true:

☐ Follows voice and tone guidelines from [Voice and Tone](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/voice_and_tone.mdc)
☐ Uses the template structure from [Article Template](mdc:.cursor/rules/templates/article_template.mdc)
☐ Frontmatter includes title and relevant tags
☐ All recommendations include "Why?" explanations
☐ Code examples are practical, runnable, and compile-safe
☐ Links to official TypeScript documentation included where relevant
☐ Trade-offs and alternatives mentioned when appropriate
☐ File name follows `snake_case` convention
☐ Content is concise but comprehensive
☐ Personal insights or real-world examples included when relevant
☐ Syntax conventions from [Syntax Conventions](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/syntax_conventions.mdc) are followed
☐ Code examples use proper syntax highlighting with language tags
☐ Good/bad examples use ✅/❌ markers when demonstrating antipatterns

## Key Principles Checklist

☐ **Focus on "why" not just "what"** - Reasoning is explained
☐ **Be practical** - Real-world applications and benefits shown
☐ **Acknowledge trade-offs** - Alternatives mentioned when relevant
☐ **Use examples** - Code examples make concepts concrete
☐ **Stay current** - TypeScript versions referenced when relevant
☐ **Be concise** - Respects reader's time while being thorough
☐ **Show, don't just tell** - Code examples and practical scenarios included

## Required Rules

The AI agent should read and follow these rules along with the subject rule:

- **[Voice and Tone](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/voice_and_tone.mdc)**: For writing style standards
