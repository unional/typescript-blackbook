# 🛠 Syntax Conventions

## Markdown Structure

- **Level-1 heading** (`#`) appears ONCE at top of file (matches frontmatter title)
- **Level-2 headings** (`##`) separate major sections (e.g., Overview, Best Practices, References)
- **Level-3 headings** (`###`) for subsections when needed
- **Horizontal rules** (`---`) to separate distinct topics within the same article

## Frontmatter

Every article MUST start with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
authors: [unional]  # Optional, include if author is known
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]  # Relevant tags for categorization
---
```

## Code Blocks

- Always include a language tag: `ts`, `json`, `jsonc`, `json5`, `sh`, `bash`
- Never use indented code blocks; always use fenced code blocks with ```
- Include comments in code to explain key points
- Keep examples practical and self-contained (preferably ≤ 25 lines for quick examples)

## Inline Code

- Use back-ticks for identifiers, types, file names, and technical terms
- Example: `Partial<T>`, `tsconfig.json`, `snake_case` ✅
- Avoid: `a variable that represents something` ❌

## Links

- Prefer reference-style links `[text][id]` with definitions at bottom
- Embed URLs directly only when unavoidable
- Link to official TypeScript documentation when referencing features
- Include Playground links for interactive examples when helpful

## Emphasis

- **Bold** for important terms, recommendations, and key concepts
- *Italics* for emphasis within sentences
- `Code` formatting for technical terms, file names, and code references

## Lists

- Use bullet points for simple lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps or best practices
- Keep list items concise and parallel in structure

## "Why?" Blocks

Always follow recommendations with a "Why?" block using blockquote format:

```markdown
> Why?

[Explanation of the reasoning, trade-offs, and practical benefits]
```

## Good vs Bad Examples

When demonstrating antipatterns, use clear markers:

- `❌ Bad` for examples to avoid
- `✅ Good` for recommended approaches

## Required Rules

The AI agent should read and follow these rules along with the subject rule:

- **[Voice and Tone](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/voice_and_tone.mdc)**: For writing style consistency
- **[Article Template](mdc:.cursor/rules/templates/article_template.mdc)**: For article structure
