# 📚 Project Overview (TypeScript Blackbook)

This repository documents real-world TypeScript techniques and best practices for professional developers.

**Primary audience**: mid- to senior-level TypeScript developers

**Desired outcome**: readers can understand TypeScript deeply and apply patterns effectively in their projects.

## Core Requirements

Cursor-AI MUST:

- **Treat every code example as production-ready** - compile-safe, type-checked, following repository conventions
- **Avoid pseudo-code or incomplete examples** - always use valid TypeScript that demonstrates the concept
- **Cite internal file paths** - reference existing code patterns from the repository when relevant
- **Explain the "why"** - not just the "what", include reasoning behind recommendations
- **Include trade-offs and alternatives** - discuss different approaches when relevant
- **Reference official documentation** - include TypeScript documentation links and version numbers when applicable

## Design Philosophy

This book focuses on *how to get the most out of TypeScript with minimal effort*.

To achieve that goal, following some coding styles is a good place to start. However, just following *what to do* can only go so far. You need to know:

- **Why** should you write code in a certain way
- **What** are the **trade-offs** you are making
- The **design** and **limitations** of the language itself

This knowledge provides the right **mindset** and **approach** to solve problems effectively.

## Required Rules

The AI agent should read and follow these rules along with the subject rule:

- **[Voice and Tone Guidelines](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/voice_and_tone.mdc)**: For writing style and persona
- **[Syntax Conventions](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/syntax_conventions.mdc)**: For markdown and code formatting
- **[Article Template](mdc:.cursor/rules/templates/article_template.mdc)**: For article structure and organization
- **[Review Rubric](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/review_rubric.mdc)**: For quality assurance checklist
